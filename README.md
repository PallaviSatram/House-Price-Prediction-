Project Overview

The House Price Prediction project uses machine learning techniques to predict the sale price of houses based on multiple property features like area, location, number of rooms, and more. Accurate predictions can help in pricing strategies, market analysis, and investment planning.

Objective

Predict house prices using regression models.

Perform data analysis to understand factors affecting house pricing.

Build a pipeline from data preprocessing to prediction.

Dataset

Features include numerical and categorical variables: square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms, year built, neighborhood, etc.

Missing values were handled, categorical features encoded, and data scaled for model training.

Dataset source: Kaggle House Prices Dataset

Methodology

Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and normalize numerical data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze distributions, correlations, and feature importance.

Model Building:

Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regression

Random Forest Regression

XGBoost Regression (Final Model)

Evaluation: Use RMSE and R¬≤ metrics to evaluate model accuracy.

Prediction: Generate predicted house prices for unseen data.

Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

Scikit-learn for machine learning models

XGBoost for gradient boosting regression

Key Learnings

Implemented full ML workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

Gained hands-on experience in feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.

Learned how different features affect house prices.

Strengthened knowledge of regression techniques and performance metrics.

Future Improvements

Add more external features like economic indicators, crime rates, or proximity to amenities.

Deploy the model as a web app for real-time predictions.

Explore deep learning models for better performance.
